\section*{Quiz 2}\label{sec:quiz-2}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the SVD of \(\begin{bmatrix}2 & 0\\0 & 3\end{bmatrix}\)?
    \item Suppose \(A\) is an \(m\times n\) matrix and \(B\) is the \(n\times m\) matrix obtained by rotating \(A\) ninety degrees clockwise on paper (not exactly a standard mathematical transformation). Do \(A\) and \(B\) have the same singular values?
    \item Two matrices, \(A, B\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times m}\) are unitarily equivalent if \(A=QBQ^*\) for some unitary \(Q\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times m}\). Is it true that \(A\) and \(B\) are unitarily equivalent if and only if they have the same singular values?
    \item Given \(A\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}\) with \(m\geq n\) and \(A\) has full rank, is \(A^*A\) nonsingular?
\end{enumerate}
